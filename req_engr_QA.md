- Group into requirements into categories; essential, desirable, optional.

## Answer:

- TODO

# Data

## Question 5:

For both input and output, what should be the format of the data? Must any data be retained for any period of time?

## Answer:

- TODO

# Physical Environment

## Question 6:

Where is the equipment to be located?  Is there one or several location? Are these constraints on size of the system(handheld/server/pc/etc)? Are there any other Costs or the other contraints on programming language, OS because of existing software components?

## Answer:

- TODO

# Interfaces

## Question 7:

Is input coming from one or more other systems ("upstream")? Is output going to one or more other systems ("downstream")? What is the protocol for the upstream and downstream systems?

## Answer:

# End Users

## Question 8:

Who will use the system?  Will there be several types of users?  What is the skill level of each user?

## Answer:

- TODO

# Performance

## Question 9:

Are there constraints on execution speed, response time, or throughput? How much data will flow through the system? How often will data be recieved or sent?

## Answer:

- TODO

# Usability and Human Factors

## Question 10:

What kind of training will be required for each type of user? How east should it be for a suser to understand and use the system?

## Answer:

- TODO

# Security

## Question 11:

Must access to the system or information be controlled?  Should each users' data be isolated from the data of other users?  Should user programs be isolated from other programs and from the OS?
