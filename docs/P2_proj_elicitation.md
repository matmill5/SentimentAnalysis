## Interview Questions

#### Customer 1 - Lindsey M Myers, M.A., Director, Marketing Strategy and Research (Destination Kent State)
The interview questions that I have selected for Lindsey Myers are with the goals in mind of understanding her role, how she utilizes data in her role, current efforts, improvements, and how our project could improve the overall process. 
- Tell me about your role. 
- What data do you utilize to inform your decision?
- What is the impact of this data? Or how significant is this data? What is it used for? Are they used to determine marketing efforts and campaigns?
- How do you analyze this data? Current limitations?
- What could be improved about the current analysis of this data? Likes and dislikes.
- How do you feel about sentiment analysis? What are the obstacles to employing this?
- Just to clarify, sentiment analysis could benefit you in your role and your department?

#### Customer 2 - Dr. Khan, Computer Science Department Chair
- How significant or how much weight do SSI carry?
This varies from department to department, and per Chairman. Most people are looking at the numbers they receive on SSI and not typically the comments. If you see a number out of range, then will potentially look into the comments. Adminstration wise - not sure what they do with eh SSI data. SSI offer Chairs the ability to observe and see how the new faculty is doing. The SSI may also assist Chairs with writing evaluations on the instructors and also allow them to give recommendations on how to improve teaching. 
- What is the impact of SSI?
Negative course evaluations - Chair talks to instructor, try to help instructor partner with a senior faculty member to mentor
- Do they inform whether a course is offered more or less?
Yes, if there is are many positive SSI on a course, they will consider incorporating that more into the curriculum and potentially offer it more often.
- How long does it take from when the SSI are submitted to when results are given?
For Fall SSI, they receive that at the beginning of the 2nd semester, early February (dependence on the Secretary's schedule). They receive a PDF scan and statistics.
- What does the current analysis of SSI data look like? How can it be improved?
They receive a PDF and Excel sheet with quantitative statistics. Improvements - not sure.
- What differs from the new online SSI versus the paper ones? Limitations?
Too early to call, have not dealt with that yet. I'm sur that it'll make life easier. This may allow more time to draw conclusions.
- Sidenotes:
    (-) Roughyl 1000 SSI for the CS Department
    (-) If we built our product, states that it will be helpful to large, entry level courses (freshman, sophomore) required courses.
    (-) Most look into the extreme cases

#### Customer 3 - Dr. Tang, Professor - School of Journalism and Design
- Role
Professor and Graduate Coordinator for Journalism and Digital Science. Her research focuses on sport communication, in regards to the International Olympic Committee and the E-Sport community. She is interested in studying E-Sport as she is intrigued of the mix of active and passive roles. As a Graduate Coordinator, she is tasked with student recruitment and scheduling. 
- Where is the data from?
Survey content analysis; secondary analysis; Twitter data; focus group on occasion
- How impactful is the data? Is it the primary driver of decisions?
It is impactful, but the primary driver of decisions comes from the analysis that she discovers in her literature review.
- How are Tweets selected?
Primarily through keywords. There are two groups of keywords and in one group there is at least "e-sport" and the other group there is at least "Olympics". We collect everything from those who use specific keywords.
- Do they have a specific hashtag?
Yes we can search by hashtags, but this produces a limited amount of results.
- What does the process of current analysis look like?
Using SPSS to analyze and sift through large datasets. Then performs statistical analysis such as regression test to answer research questions and is then able to describe findings.
- How long does it take to complete?
Real quick, less than a week for the analysis. The data cleaning takes a while.
- Tools used?
SPSS for regression and correlation. However, the problem with SPSS is that it can handle only a certain amount of data, unable to do large datasets. She states the limit she believes is 10,000; however the largest she has worked on is 2000 cases and 200 verbals. SPSS is not capable for big data analysis, nor does it work with sentiment analysis.
- Preferred format: CSV, SPV
- We are going to receive not a large amount of data.
- She is interested in charts, if time permits.
- She is interested in context analysis, in addition to sentiment analysis. She will give specifics later.
