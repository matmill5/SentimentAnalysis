## Description of the problem

Currently, our customers and users are manually interpreting written text from various sources like course evaluations, peer reviews, twitter mentions, etc.  

The problem is that manual interpretation is slow, unquantified, and prone to discrepencies in understanding between readers.  Our goal is provide automatic, programmatic, and quantifiable intepretations of written text.  The outcome is to provide our customers/users with better understanding, a stronger analytic toolset, and the ability to provide better service in their various roles.

We want to make better, more responsive, facualty, departments, and universities.
