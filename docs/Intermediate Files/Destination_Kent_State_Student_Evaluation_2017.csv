,,,,My favorite part about Destination Kent State was basically the evening activities provided to the students.,I'm expected to graduate for these 4 years I'm at Kent State.,
I'm not sure if these really helps or not but I know that I had a lot of problems trying to get the links to work for the assessments and I know that a lot of other people did too. ,The advising appointment was very useful and did help a lot and it showed me that a lot of people must have rushed their assessments like I did and that was comforting. The only negative to my appointment was the lack of sympathy and understanding that I did in fact rush my assessments and it isn't an accurate showcase of my intelligence so I will be retaking the ones I am allowed.,,,The comfort and honesty that the staff and the flash guides provided to us. It made the tour more realistic and helped me understand just how much I'm going to be adjusting for college life.,To do my best and to represent my school as best as I can while also enjoying my time here.,
Yes for the alexs math portion i remember i had to go through a long process with a kent admissions man of emailing back and forth and eventual doing a step by step instruction over the phone because the links to the assement were broken,"I adored my Academic Advising experience. To start my Adviser was an exceptionally delightful woman named Erin Liggett. She was extremely helpful energetic, pleasant, and informative. She provided me with information on my classes individually, and was tremendously patient and helpful with my upsurd amount of queries. She helped build a schedual that i simply could not be happy with and honestly was the best part of my DKS visit. Also I truly enjoyed the schedualer i met before her. I cannot seem to recall her name but she was equally delightful. I recall she said her parents were born in India but were of persian decent. I believe anyways i did speak to so many people that it was hard to keep perfect track. I do know she is a junior and sat on the right hand side of her room as you would see from the door and was apart of the Young Life christian community and taught me a new way to draw a star which i still contest. She was extremely helpful and an absolute delight to talk with which does make me ashamed to say I forgot her name. (""Sighs dramatically"" woe to my ever forgetful brain)",I provided a lot of relavent information but was not concise at all. Most of the information took atleast 30min to descibe for only about 5 to 10 min of actual content.,The obtaining of books,Honestly it was my academic advising. That experience with Ms.Liggett made it all seem so real so exciting. She was helpful in a way that i have had very few people be in my road of academics. She may have only met me once and only for a short amount of time but I am extremely grateful. It truly made me excited for the upcoming semester. Give her my highest regards as for the first time in a VERY long time I believe that someone has sincerely earned them.  ,To give my utmost in the things I i endeavor to do from the beginning to the very end. To strive to not be just a student but become an exceptional person to become someone who Kent can brag about as a Distinguished Alumni,"Thank you very much everyone you have provided me with a truly wondrous experience. Shoutout to miss Bridget, Olivia, and especially miss Paige of our flashguilds you are all three superb individuals and I wish you the utmost. Liv hav fun with flashguilding i hope people remember to stay fully clothed and you dont accidently sit on someone even though it did make you a friend. To Bridgett I hope you get to see Hamilton in New York its truly a excellent experience. To Paige I wish you the best of times wishes and hope for you and your endeavors especially in your new position with the council tech thing (apologies I forgot the specific title please to not take that as a diminishment i sounds positively phenominoal. and your prospects on become president.

Also, I should take advantage of all the people and other resources around me to better myself.",By doing less activities with family members and guests it will allow students to have an easier time to get to know other students. I had both of my parents with me and every time I finally met someone I thought I could get along with my parents would want to hang out with me since our acitivites were the same.

My father then came, but I was upset that he didn't have what he needed to roll around in his wheel-chair or any escorts to help guests in wheel-chairs, he was also placed on the 3rd floor which made everything more hard for him. I love that every worker at Kent State was so helpful and nice, I just wish we had more time to have people be more comfortable with each other. I also was supposed to take my Math placement test, but they didn't leave a sticker on my paper- which caused me to miss it and miss activities the following day. Since the activities were in another building at some points, it was difficult for my sad to get around campus...

The Flashguides were easy and super fun to talk to (and dance with!), and everyone - I do mean everyone! - was so welcoming. Thank you for everything. ","What I expect from me is my best. My best attitude, my best effort, my best thoughts and words. Hopefully, that's what others expect as well, because that's what they'll get.
