## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create enterpise-business value through the use of sentiment analysis.  Sentiment analysis is the process of surmising context/tone/etc from written text, it's a sub-discipline of natural language processing (NLP).  Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for a world with increasingly digital text.

Sentiment analysis can be performed on any formatted set of digital text.  We can extend the reach of sentiment analysis by using other technologies bridge the gap between the pysical world and digital world, a.k.a translate non-digital data into a digital form.  For example, optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to process images of printed, non-digital text, into digital form.  Then, this data can be processed with sentiment analysis.

Consider another possibility, transcription of audio from telephone conversations.  First, audio transciption technologies can be used to translate audio into digital text.  Then, this digital text can be processed with natural language processing tools.

There are a variety of other sources which can be analyized with natural language processing.  This project focuses on processing data sources that will provide meaningful feedback to Kent State staffers.
