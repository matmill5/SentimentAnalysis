I took the assessment a year before DKS and do not remember enough to give accurate feedback.,"There were some technical difficulties during my scheduling session which forced my advisor to spend a little extra time with me, though thankfully it did not delay him from his next student.",There were some other sessions I would have liked to attend but didn't have the opportunity to because of the limit of four sessions.,More energy after walking all day.,Something that I would have enjoyed is a tour of where your classes would be after scheduling on day two.,"Academic advising was my favorite part because it was the most important. While getting general knowledge of the campus and the way it functions is fine, knowing how I'm going to get to my goals is much better.","You placed the karaoke session right outside of my dorm's window, which was open. It was really difficult to sleep."

I took mine as a CCP student ,You are so stuck on the credit aspect of my schedule that you are not listening to my needs. Please keep in mind some students have to pay for college themselves and don't have the money to waste on classes that are pointless and don't contribute to my degree.,Please make this more engaging for students who have already been going to college as a CCP student. It was very repetitive and no matter how many times everyone at Kent campus swore it was completely different than the one I had to go to in Twinsburg I could not find anything besides resident services to be different. ,Not feeling forced to attend another orientation after I already attended one,You should add a shorter alternative program for CCP students because I already was told everything that was said in the orientation. Also if you are going to swear it is entirely different than the orientation on another campus actually make it entirely different. This was my second orientation and I was not happy to find out it was basically the same after everyone telling me it was entirely different. The only thing that was different was resident services which you shouldn't make all the students listen to if you are not staying in the residence halls. ,Nothing I really didn't appreciate having to go through another orientation just to find out they are telling me the exact same thing. It was a hassle to schedule and a waste of my time I took off work for this. I have to pay for college myself and I had to take an entire day off just to attend this. ,"Please, Please, Please make it more engaging for students that already have college experience. It is rather unfair to force them to sit through all the intro stuff they already had to listen too. Try to make more options for students that are not commuting I felt really out of place because most of the speeches included things about living on campus which doesn't apply to me. Also, try not to lie to students and force them to take another orientation when it really isn't ""Completely different."" This is a quote multiple people on the Kent campus told me which was false. "

"The test did not work and skipped several sections that I did not even get tested on ... just offered me a 0 for that particular section and as a result, I have  to take a boost class.  Not at all happy with how the placement test performed. I do not care about my score as long as it is my actual score",It is very reassuring when your advisor really seems to care about you personally.,,I was good. Did not need anything more in the way of a connection for that particular day,Should have spent more time on resources and personalizing the DKS event if you are going to have a limited number of students attend at a time.,I really enjoyed the resources just outside the ballroom and would have liked to have spent more time with that.,

,"Very helpful for working around who i am so my classes and schedule fit comfortably but still provide what i want to get out of my academics. She was easy to connect with and made me feel at ease about the whole scenario,  11/10 experience,  everything i hoped for and more.",,"More people from my major, more major based activities (more activities geared towards nerdier people in general) more icebreaker get to know you stuff because i am a shy nerd but i like to get to know people.","Let the parents break off earlier, it felt hovery and us students didn't get as much time as we needed to find our own niches, because parents.

The advisors are helpful beyond words and I’m glad they care about each student on such a personal level. ,,"The social activities gave us that foundation for the opportunity to make friends. I was able to meet people and find common interests quickly, and I was even able to hang out with them throughout the night. ","Maybe a little bit more of a campus tour, one that goes more in depth than just the college tour taken before making a college decision. ","Meeting everyone.

",,I just have to feel comfortable in a place before putting myself out there. If I had more time I could of meet more people I feel. ,There should be a campus tour option. Also more obvious options of things to do night one for people who aren’t into party type events. ,Getting to know some of the flash guides and hear their stories was nice. My advising appointment was also very good. ,
N/A,,,,,My rooming experience at dks was a lot better than I expected it to be. But other than that I had a good time playing volleyball and listening to music late at night at the end of day one ,
"I sort-of got lost in the webpage before taking the exam... bear in mind, this is from a guy who builds/repairs/sets-up computers for a living.  I am not sure what caused it, but somehow, somewhere, something on the testing website mislead me.  I cannot provide specifics ... so my feedback is most likely useless.  UNLESS I add this to it:    I only had to take the Math placement (both Flashline & ALEKS reported this).  Completed it a week before my DKS.  I get to DKS, and I spend 1/2 an hour debating with an adviser (I think) why I did NOT have to take the foreign language placement, including pulling up Flashline & my HS transcript.  It eventually ended with me successfully showing why I had no need to take it, but in this whole process, I missed a meeting time-slot I would have liked to get to that day.    PLEASE, check software/people about this, as I am sure I was not the only one who had this issue whilst attending DKS this Summer, 2019.  Thank you in advance, and God bless!","Not much else to add.  It went smoothly; I met with 4 advisers in total while at DKS, and all 4 were extremely helpful  in contacting other advisers about questions they could not CONFIDENTLY answer.  I like that - willing to rely on other's knowledge to get the best answer(s) possible...    Very satisfied.  Had no issues getting all my courses to line up with each other. ",,"More major-specific get-togethers.  After the ONE small table group discussion during our major-specific timeslot, I... pretty much connected with nobody else.  It's partially my fault; I am an introvert.  But the social events, including the dance + 10th floor of Wright Hall, were quite successful.  I met 2 African-American siblings/cousins (unsure which), and they were really nice & willing to talk with me.  Turns out, they are living on campus whilst I am commuting, however we all exchanged social media contact information.","Communities.  And Organizations.  I learned more about them from Flashguides than from Formal presentations, regardless of Kent State's intentions with going about explaining these unique student-led bodies.  If slightly more emphases were placed on informing new students of where to find Organizations (perhaps even give incoming DKS students a list of current-year Student Organizations), it would help freshman connect easier.","The food.  Yes, it was delicious!    On a more serious note, I really liked the tours & activities done with the Flashguides.  Although the informative sessions completely accomplished their purposes, and I felt much more calm after absorbing everything, the student-led, student-focused time-slots were my favorite.  Especially in the evening/night, where I could venture out and... process everything from the day.  That allowed me to ""gather my thoughts"" & prepare myself for the next day, including my advising appointment the following morning.",

No,,,Good conversation skills,Add onto Day 2 because I feel like we were just thrown in the trash as soon as the new DKS students came in. They would not even serve us food anymore when it’s an overnight trip for 26 & 27 but as soon as the 27th came it was done for us. That is corny.,I liked the Flashguides.,Eastway food is terrible it is not good at all. And the drinks are too watery.

,My advisor was amazing!!,"It was ALOT of talking. It was hard for us students to stay engaged because it felt like the same few things were repeated in every speech, just a slightly different way. I had also already heard alot of this in tours and honors college visits, so it felt like a waste of time when we could have been doing something else. ","More time to connect, less big group talks.

That’s where I connected with students most. I also really liked the flash guides introduction! They were really welcoming and energetic ,
The website was a little hard to navigate when finding the test. I thought that we had the option to take the test twice as I read in the directions to improve your score if you were not happy. But when I went back the next day to take the test it said it was proctored which was very confusing so I could not take the test again to improve my score.,Caroline was very personable and took the time to get to know me as a person. She answered all of my questions and loaded me with information on classes and what’s best for me so I appreciate that. I also worked with Mary Kay to fix my schedule because it was not done correctly and she emailed so fast. She gave me loads of information and made my schedule perfect for me so I definitely appreciate that. ,I feel that the session in the morning was very drug out for no reason. The provosts speech was insanely long and repetitive. I thought the first lady who had spoken gave us all of the information that we needed and we did not need to hear the provosts hour long speech that was very drug out. It also was very weird screaming out that we need help which I did not think was appropriate by any means. ,Everyone there was super cool and laid back. All the students were fun and cool to be around and don’t be afraid to ask questions because someone will help.,I think there needs to be more time spent on have to navigate around Kent. I think they need to go over buildings and what’s held in them to help incoming freshman ,The food honestly. It was incredible and there were so many options. ,Please add water places around the campus. I was extremely dehydrated for two days. Really stress to either bring water bottles or have them available for us kids walking around in 85 degree weather with no waters for hours. That was something a lot of students were complaining about with feeling sick and dehydrated from the lack of water. 
,They made it so easy and I left feeling assured that they would have my back throughout school. ,It was very overwhelming and I had a lot of overwhelming papers to fill out in not very much time. ,We should have split into groups depending on what flags we put on our name tags in order to meet more people with similar interests. ,,I loved exploring downtown because it was the first time I wasn’t with a big group or my parents that day and the first time I really felt like a college student. ,
I thought the test was ran very well. It was a little confusing navigating the website to take the test. I also thought we could take the test twice but when I went to it said the test was  proctored so I was a little upset when I couldn’t retake to get a better score. ,Caroline was very nice and helpful to me during my academic advising. I really appreciate the fact that she was personable and really wanted to get to know me and what I like. She helped me with whatever questions I had and also recommended things for me to take.,,,,,

It would be better to give the welcome/congratulation speach, touch on important topics with a small q&a, give a proper campus tour and have the advising/scheduling session. The multiple sessions of story time with the guides is unecessary. And there seemed to be several sessions that reiterated the same things. And the extra socializing sessions were unnecessary. It should've been a fun option to stay and socialize instead of forcing us to socialize. You need to keep in mind thise who have social anxiety or feel unsettled around a large group of strangers. We are all adults and we've all been through kindergarten, we know how to make friends and socialize on our own. Also, making it mandatory for the students to stay in the dorms is not that great. It would be better if staying in the dorm rooms was a fun option. Not everyone will be staying on campus during the academic year. so, not making it not an option to stay in the dorms is a little silly in my humble opinion. Staying in the dorms overnight would've seemed like somefun if it were, again, optional. Like a fun ""college experience"" deal instead of a mandated ""you have to"" deal. I know this probably wont make an impact on anything, but there is my opinion. Thank you. "

,,,"If students could have been able to be grouped together or interacted with people of similar interests, whether that be information provided by the student before attending DKS, or whatever worked",More student interaction would be nice,Meeting with fellow students and bonding with them over Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.,"The scheduling of DKS was an absolute mess. Before the first presentation, if a student was late, they wouldn’t be able to explore the multiple student organizations in the morning. Additionally, being moved from other buildings to the Student center for an hour, and then moving to Eastway Center for another hour, only to immediately return to the student center is exhausting and pointless. On day two, the schedule was even more confusing. As I needed to visit the One Stop to discuss financial aid, why was the reserved time for DKS students at the same time that students were supposed to be in advising meetings and meeting with the Flashguides? There was no coordination between different branches of KSU evident in that sense. There was also very little time for students and families to do other things that they needed to do, i.e. discuss financial aid, purchase common reading books and so forth. To do what I needed to accomplish, I hope that I did not miss crucial information while I was doing other necessary things. If KSU wants new students to attend Orientation for a day and a half, there is no reason why a few hours of free time couldn’t be included in the day"

,"The way you went about taking up time while others went was badly done. I had the very last appointment and it was long grueling.

no,,,The group chat we all joined when we got there was actually a really good way to kick-start a few friendships. ,I don’t personally think so. Everything was really  thorough and helpful. ,"Honestly, the flashguides were my favorite part. They made the whole going to college and starting a new life chapter seem less scary because they showed us they were doing it. they were really easy to connect with and made DKS a lot of fun ","Going into this, i really didn’t want to do an overnight stay and have to do DKS at all. However i am really happy with the outcome and i’m glad this was something new students had to do. "

,"I was never told that being in a living learning community would affect my scheduling. I was never informed that I was going to be with the members of this  community for every one of my classes; I am dissatisfied with this as I wanted to be with different people in my various classes.  Despite this, I was satisfied with my scheduling as my advisors were very helpful and understanding.  ",,,,,

Add a calculator for any and all questions. In my school everything in math was taught on how to use the calculator for the question given so at times it was difficult to do because I didn’t know how to do most problems by hand. I’m speaking for my school not so sure if others feel the same. ,,,Give us time to introduce one another ,"Financials.

,,My family and I loved the guy who gave the “Living on Campus” session. He was very funny! He was also relatable and gave helpful information at the same time. ,If we did more games our group activities that got people together and had them work together. ,Maybe add more time finding our own way around campus and also adding group games or activities to get more people to connect with each other. ,I loved the beginning where we made our name tags with the flags.

,I really enjoy how involved your advisor is in your first year and beyond because it gives you a contact going into college.,,,I think there should be more time broken up by major so you can get to know the kids that you will spend most of your time with in college and get to know them a little bit better.,My favorite part was meeting with my advisor and setting up my schedule. It put me at ease and made me feel more confident coming to Kent State in the fall. I also enjoyed hearing about the flash guides experiences and get an idea of what worked for them and what didn’t.,
,,,,,,
,,,More time in our college groups,More things for commuters. There was a lot of information that didn’t apply to us at all,Tours,It felt very useless as a commuter to have to spend a day and a half on campus. I think a lot of the information was good but also very guided toward people residing on campus. There just needs to be more information for commuters

There is no calculator use unless shown.,,,If the parents and students were separated earlier.,,I loved how you got to choose what to do and where you want to go. I liked how we walked around to get to know the campus more.,

,,The one professor that spoke during “your first class” that repeated “Kay” after every three words.. should probably realize that and try to fix it as it was EXTREMELY distracting. ,More mandatory group activities ,,Listening to the man that spoke about living on campus.

Never got to ask any of my questions that I had about CCP credit nor AP credit.,,,,,"The fact that this program is mandatory is completely ridiculous, especially as neither my mom or I learned anything new. Being a CCP student and already planning on commuting means that all I cared about was my advising appointment and possibly learning more about finances, and everything could have been done in both 1 day and without having to go through the dirge of this program. I didn't even get to do my scheduling, as this school's website was not working, as it often does. This whole process was worthless and unnecessary. We were both often bored and unable to actually do anything we had wanted to do on campus."
The site is very confusing and I was unaware that you could take the test twice until after DKS,My academic advisor was very helpful and super nice. I was able to get all of my questions answered and was in and out in a timely manor. ,The “ask the flash guides” and “confessions of a flash guide” were not very entertaining and were somewhat boring. ,N/A,Spend more time talking about where to get books and also more time walking around campus so we could get comfortable with it. ,I loved being able to meet so many incoming students that shared similar interests as me or were in the same major. That makes it so much easier to have peace of mind about the fall. ,N/A

,,,"Sharing majors and experiences was a big help, and probably the main reason I talked to them at all.","Maybe explaining the move-in process? I know we get emails and things about it, but I'm an auditory learner, so having someone tell me really helps me understand","It wasn't even one particular experience, it was more that no matter where I turned I was reassured that I was wanted at KSU and that I would be supported and given any help I needed to succeed.","The whole experience can be pretty overwhelming, especially for atypical brains and people with SPD, but overall you guys do an amazing job and I'm so so so happy to be able to attend KSU this fall."

"I would have liked to see a little bit more communication from the university about which placement tests I needed to take, how long they would take, and which classes they would ultimately impact. I felt that I went into the tests not knowing exactly what they were and how much of my time they would take up. The actual technology for the Placement Assessments worked perfectly though!",,That was a really good session! It gave me an opportunity to meet other students who share a major similar to mine and got me thinking more seriously about study abroad programs.,"The person I connected with was my roommate, which meant that we were forced to talk to each other to some degree. I think having other activities where I was forced to talk to other students, even if it was just introducing ourselves, would have helped.",,One of my favorite parts was the opportunity to meet with an advisor. This helped me to feel more confident in the support system that I have at KSU and relieved some of my nerves in terms of what type of course load I will have in the fall.,My DKS experience was great overall! My only problem was that I felt rushed during scheduling and so I ended up choosing a schedule that was pretty full on some days and I had to call my advisor once I got home and make some changes. 
,,,Getting to interact with kids who had similar interests to me. Maybe filling out a questionnaire before you attend of your interests and letting you interact with kids who had those similar interests as you. ,,scheduling my classes,

,,,,,The food was really good. And meeting new people ,
,As I said before I felt rushed. I also felt like my experience wasn’t the best because he wasn’t prepped about my interests/situation. I want to major in business with a concentration in nursing home administration. I had done previous research so I know this is possible but he didn’t really understand what was happening and I just got more confused. I feel like the advisors may want to take more time to figure out/look into the things we fill out before we actually meet. ,,Random roommates only. It’s not as easy to meet people when friends room with friends from their hometown. ,,Hanging out with the flashguides. They were so energetic and interactive. Great group of people. ,Shorten the speaker times at the beginning of day 1. To a lot of people it seemed repetitive and we lost interest because of that. Also the big group chat for summer communication kinda backfired because most of the students just talked on that during presentations. 
,,,,,,
,Was very nice and went out of her way to help me outside of our appointment.,,A lot of kids stayed with their parents instead of going out talking to other kids,"My friend is still confused on how to get loans by herself, so maybe more stuff on financial aid",Social time and being with my specific college. Also asking the flash guides questions.,I just can’t stay focused in long periods of talking like the morning session. It was still good information tho.

,,,"Making one friend leads to making another friend of their friend and eventually you build a small network. I do wish there had been more ""Get to Know People"" events where we could just mill about a talk with others and do other ice breakers but I understand that's hard to do with such a large group.",Definitely more ice breakers. They're fun and hello people feel a little more comfortable.,Being around friends and meeting new people.,"It was fantastic, I've never experienced anything like it. The speeches did tend to drone on during the first day and there was a lot of unnecessary repetition. But getting to be on campus and in a dorm and around others was enjoyable beyond measure."
,,,,I would shorten the whole experience. I felt the morning half I already experienced during Flash day and it was VERY repetitive. The whole experience should fit in one day. Half the kids I talked to including myself left during the sessions and went downtown to dinner. We did so because we were bored and it was a extremely long day. ,My favorite part was going to my college and picking classes. Also getting my flash card. ,It was extremely dragged out and quit boring at times.

To have some multiple choice questions on the math assessment. ,"I thought is was very helpful, but I would like to have seen the personal roadmap to see my classes and the actual map.

,My academic advisor was very helpful. She was able to answer every question I asked and provided me with all of the resources I may need during my first year of college.,,"I really liked the game that Charlie had made, where we formed a circle with the group of students and tossed a ball around. On the ball he had written random questions that ranged from ice-breakers to ones that were more personal. Whoever the ball was thrown to had to answer the question of either  thumb the question had landed on.",,Playing the game that I mentioned earlier that Charlie had created. I also enjoyed the dance party with karaoke at the end of the night. Even though I did not participate in the singing I was able to meet other students during the time spent there. The flash guides did a very good job at getting everyone to socialize and connect with one another.,

It’s a better experience doing an exam on paper rather than on a computer ,,,Introducing us to those in our major earlier in the program and making an appointment with our advisor earlier ,Campus tours and downtown tours for everyone and how to connect with faculty outside the classroom,,A shorter program would be more beneficial since students lost interest after being talked to for hours. Need more time making connections with peers and need to be able to have some freedom in between sessions
