,"I was discouraged from taking more than 15 credit hours in my fist semester.  I would like to take a minimum of 18 hours, and would like to possibly look into 21 hours.  I am fully aware of my personal limitations, and I know how large of a workload I can handle.  I am looking into changing my schedule because the woman I met with (unfortunately, she never informed me of her name) was more concerned with comparing my enthusiasm for my career with how she feels about Harry Potter that paying attention to my goals.",,,,,

,,I have the same comment about forcing athletes to attend when they already have their schedules.  The Administration Address was extremely boring.  ,N/A,"NOT the FERPA.  There were two times, in two different sessions, where this was discussed.  DKS beat a dead horse on that one.",I loved the discussion about tutoring and what is available at the library.,
DKS was a great experience and I very much look forward to being a freshman in the fall!,,,,,,
,It was fun and interactive and cool. ,,More social situations that didn't involve moments when the parents were around.,"Tours. Tour of the campus and downtown areas. Since the college of arts and science was so large, we didn't get the opportunity to tour downtown. That was left up to us.",I loved talking with the flash guides and talking with the Advisor and getting my Flashcard. ,
,,,,,,
"No, the website itself functioned well and had a very easy to follow tutorial before the exam.","My academic adviser was great! I was really nervous to inconvenience them with my uncertainty, but I felt like they were ready to take on anything. I'm excited, it sort of brings stability in this uncertain life.",,"I think that wasn't really the fault of the school. I met some people, some that I was disinterested in, and one that genuinely scared me. I think it was sort of a luck thing, because I probably could have made friends if I met some other people somehow. I'm just not the most outgoing person, is all.","I would add some sort of event where you can make friends with other students, like a speeddating thing where you describe yourself, your interests, and then maybe become friends.","I really liked the flashguides- hearing their stories, and when we split into our colleges and played games with the flashguides.",
"I would suggest streamlining the interface. The constant clicking to create the form of the answer was mildly frustrating, and felt a little tedious. I felt as if it took longer than it should have as a result. I also believe it would be beneficial to offer a proctored version at the local campuses of test-takers.","My meeting with my academic advisor was excellent, and as a result I feel very comfortable with what I will be going into this fall, although I do wish that I had known more about classes and what I needed to take or had time to take long before DKS and my experience with Academic Advising. I felt like I was going in blind and had very little handle on my options before hand, which was very frustrating.",,"To some extent, I had trouble connecting with people because the schedule was so rushed. I managed, but it wasn't the easiest thing, especially being that I am a little introverted to begin with.",TRANSPORTATION! I still have no idea how to handle the bus system or other local forms of transportation. ,"I enjoyed the splitting up and meeting with people in your specific college. I met people I really got along with, and who I will most likely be around during my time at the University.",
,,,"In the first day at DKS we spent a lot of time with our families, so it was difficult meeting new people. Then when we finally broke off from our parents, we did a couple icebreakers, but the groups were so large and it was very hard making connections with others.","Buying/Renting books, how to set up your dorm room(how to: loft, half loft, rearrange furniture etc), exact dimensions of the dresser, desk and closet. It would be nice if the Flashguides went further into detail about what the first week-month of classes looks like. ",I loved exploring our specific colleges. ,
It was not clear enough before I started the math placement test how long it was going to take and what resources I needed to have accessible.,,For those who did not take their placement test before arrival were told to take it during the safety presentations which I believe was irresponsible due to the fact that there was a vaping incident that set off the fire alarm at 2:30 in the morning. ,,Highlight the psychological services and the function of more of the departments at Kent,,Thank you for reading these :) you da real mvp

,,,,,The party,
Maybe do a shorter version of the survey you use for roommates for the people that we roomed with. My roommate and I had different sleeping habits which made it hard for me to sleep.

Somehow have a study guide or what not because I don’t feel that it truly tested ur ability to do math because of the fact that there’s nothing to look over and you weren’t currently doing stuff with the equations to be able to answer it correctly ,I wish I had an option to not have a 7:45,It was very helpful and a  Good experience ,Separating into our favorite sports or something ,Parking for freshman and how to get shuttle ,My favorite part was the kiva with the flash guides ,

,"I scheduled my classes with a current student and then met an acedwmic advisor, yet I wish it was vice versa, I wish I could’ve gotten more advice directly from my academic advisor on what classes to take and why ","There was a lot of being talked directly at vs being talked with and asked questions, it made me very very tired anytime we were in the ballroom and I had a hard time absorbing information. I feel it would be better to just read that info in a packet or talk about it in small groups ",,,,
,My advisors were very helpful and informative with our situation. They took their time and made out session personalized. You could tell they spent a lot of time and effort helping to put together our schedule. ,,,,,

,"It was quite overwhelming, but went well. ","Repetition is somewhat of a drag but it was a good introduction to the options and choices accessible to students at KSU, and minimized the informational overload well. ",,Looking at the complete four year roadmap to graduation. ,The people. ,
,,,More time to socialize ,,I loved getting to hangout with everyone at night and make friends. ,
,,,If we could have communicated with other students from different majors,No,I liked the activities and game part that took place on the end of the day ,It would have been nice if there were water bottles are if we were directed to the vending machines. 
,,,,Navigation around campus ,,
,"Because there were so many students to get through with scheduling and advising, I found myself rushing through a decision if I had to modify my schedule during the actual registration process. However, I do feel like I got to know my advisor a bit and could come to her with and concerns about my schedule when the semester starts, so I don’t feel as though anything is irreversible from my hasty decision making. ","(I think this was the session in which we all sat together at tables, grouped by similar majors?) I really liked the smaller group feel... It gave me a chance to engage with a handful of people without reeling in a sea of kids figuring out who I should engage with.  Having people’s names on the table also helped my remember people’s names better so that I could be like “hey, xxx! i say with you earlier...” and already have that connection. The environment was also chill and relaxed, which was super nice after all the hype-up stuff. ","This might sound stupid, but having the choice to go to a more relaxed session like going to one of the local coffee shops/ the used book store or a more outgoing session like frisbee/ karaoke/ volleyball would allow students to take a break from super involved activities without having to go back to the dorm with no one else around. That way they can still socialize with other incoming students, but in a quieter, less intense environment. ","Maybe mention the Wick Poetry center as another resource/ thing to get involved in? I stumbled upon the center as I browsed the Kent website a couple months ago, and was surprised I’d never been told about it during any of my visits to Kent State. ","I really liked when we had time to talk to people of similar majors in the one session with Jenga, etc. See reasons in that previous response a couple questions back :)",

"Lots of lecturing- I know it's a lot of information we need to know, but maybe split the lecturing up more. Would've loved to have more time to sit with my advisor but I understand there's a lot of students. Otherwise I had fun !",My advisor was helpful but I felt I didn't get to speak much about what I wanted.

,,,Meeting more people of my major ,N/a,The evening social activities ,
,"My meeting with an Academic Advisor to schedule classes was amazing. She made sure I was informed about transfer credit, credit hours, courses i will be taking, my schedule and where my classes were located. She also made sure to give me instructions on what to do if one of my classes was not scheduled within a week, as I had a possible conflict. However, that course was assigned the very next day with no problems. I felt so much more comfortable and less stressed after talking with her.",,,Getting to know the campus more. I was mainly in three buildings for DKS all near the others. I would have liked to see more of campus with a guide to become more familiar in the overall layout.,Scheduling my classes was my favorite part. It made me extremely excited for what is to come in the fall.,
,,,,,,
,Advisor scheduled 21 credit hours because he didn't take into account the 2 honors classes already scheduled and assigned me to 2 classes that were full and could not be registered.  Student registrar had to fix my schedule and then we went back to validate new schedule with a different advisor. Information that was filled out online prior to DKS was not reviewed by the Advisor and he had no knowledge of the courses needed for a psychology major and had to keep going online to check course requirement.,,,More accurate Destination Kent State App so that I don't have to rely on paper schedules.  Parents schedule segment on Destination Kent State App.  Allow Honors support staff to give guided tour of Stopher/Johnson hall and dorm room.  More time for Honors students to meet each other.,Another DKS student had an older friend on campus that took 5 of us on an in depth tour of the campus instead of going to the party.  It was great for the 5 of us to become friends and learn the real campus life.,
,,,Met them outside during the activities and the conversation sparked about clothing and just held on well from there. ,Take the art students to the fashion school when touring!,meeting new friends,

,,,,Maybe a better and more in depth  campus tour,I really enjoyed being able to interact with students of the same major at dks along with all the flashguides who were extremely helpful. ,
Have an indicator at the top saying what number question you are on and the total,It seems to be a little bit confusing with being honors and having ccp credits but besides that the advising was set up well and ran smoothly,N/a,,,,

,"Marie was very friendly and welcoming, and I felt very comfortable talking to her about any and all my concerns and questions. ",,,Maybe mention counciling that is available for students if they start to feel anxiety or depression,I liked visiting downtown and scheduling classes. ,
I wasn’t aware that I could take a language placement exam for Spanish since I want to continue learning Spanish. Just a quick notification that there are other optional placement exams would be helpful.,,,More time between sessions without parents,,My favorite part was the icebreakers with the other students in my program that happened before the walk downtown.,
,,,,Finding your way around campus.,"Flashguide stories were phenomenal. They really hit home for me, especially. I liked connecting with our flashguide and asking questions.",
Get the older gentleman that went the first day of DKS to provide some jokes during his speech because everyone was falling asleeping from him talking.,,,,,,
,,It needs more interactive and less mind numbingly boring. As the day went on group of 5-10 people were leaving at each break. They were the smart ones. What was said at the resource fair was completely repeated making the lectures completely boring and useless.,,How to get around campus,It being over. ,"It was horribly long and boring, I just happy it’s over. I think we should schedule class the first day and make the rest optional. I didn’t need to waste my time hearing stuff I already know in an incredibly boring format. The information could be condensed as there was a lot repeating. I just happy I only have to go to this once."
,,,,,,
,,,"For me, connections take longer than a day and a half to form.",It would be nice to have a tour to all the places that are talked about.,I liked the food!,
,Again just wish I could work with my actual advisor. ,,To be honest I would enjoy more fun programs for students. There was so much information that I will never need to know but my parents care about. I just wish students had more party events seeing there is so many pep rally’s and everything I wish I could have seen one. ,I would have loved to know what it’s like having the schools spirit. ,The night time of day one where we really get to connect with students and flash guides. ,
"Complete Placement Assessments shortly after completing your prior schooling, so that any relevant information would be in your mind more likely. Take the tests seriously and allow even more than the recommended time to make sure that you feel no stress of time constraint while taking and show your very best.","My advisor, Ms. Truella Harper, was very well informed and helped me feel secure in my decisions. She helped very clearly guide the actual scheduling process to follow.","It was neat to be separated by College, meeting specifically students with similar/related academic interests.",,"Some more descript and defined instruction on where, how, and when to buy books and supplies would have been helpful in addition to its mention in my DKS session.","Exploring campus, both through guided tours and on break with my family, was very fun and rewarding, increasing my excitement of Kent State and providing a useful backbone to work off of come KSU Kickoff in Fall.",DKS is a really good idea for acclimating new students to the campus and atmosphere. I know that it already has proved to help me get out of my comfort zone in a good way.

No,,,Just having time to talk ,No,,"I am very disappointed with the way this “system” was carried out. First, both my mom and myself work full time every day. Both of us had to call off almost 2 days of work which I just started and it was not easy to take off. No one has ever heard of a college making it mandatory for students to spend the night for a what should have been simple orientation. My normal schedule had to be completely rearranged just for me to make it up there. You guys need to make the overnight stay optional or for students who are staying on campus only. I literally got nothing out of staying overnight except a lack of sleep. Also, the program and lectures need to be shortened to just the necessary information to begin the semester. Some information could have been given as paperwork instead of spending the extra unneeded time verballing saying it. "
,"My advisor was nice and explained things to me, but my scheduling was messed dup due to my lacking in certain classes and had to be redone, which made my scheduling process longer. ",N/Ai,"Honestly, just the people I was grouped with were about as antisocial as I was, so it was hard to talk to them. ",I think maybe there should be an activity where you have more chances to talk with different people. Like speed dating or something.,"My favorite part of the DKS program would have to be the scheduling. Yes, I had fun at the other sessions and enjoyed my friend's companies, but the scheduling just made it so REAL for me and it was just so so thrilling.","Keep doing a good job, you're doing great! :)  "
Online was very convenient and less stressful than taking an exam in a classroom setting. ,Very helpful and knowledgeable. ,,,"A financial overview including scholarships, financial aid, and other factors.

,,,,,,
,The graduate student who helped me was great. I felt like I walked out of the meeting satisfied with my schedule and comfortable navigating the process. ,,I feel like when the parents where around kids where less likely to reach out and meet new people. So I feel more time when the parents where completely separate would encourage connections.,,I enjoyed the evening activities when the students had a chance to explore the campus and get to know each other.,The flash guides all seemed very approachable and helpful and if there was a question I felt comfortable asking.
,,,,,,
,,,Somethings that people said I didn’t agree with but I’m not one to say someone’s opinion is wrong so I stayed quiet because a lot of people’s viewpoints were not the same as mine. ,There’s so many questions that students have and some weren’t asked because they were in large groups and didn’t want to look dumb so having some one on one time with someone may be a good idea. ,Getting to ask the flash guides questions. I like to know what I’m walking into before I get there and they helped answer what I wanted to know. ,Studying Abroad was talked about but maybe not enough. I wasn’t aware that Studying Away was an option and that is something that I was more interested in and there was little to no mention about it.

",Schedule my classes ,"For myself I would have like for my parent and I to be able to to stay in the same dorm room so I could ask for opinions on my classes.

,,,It was really on our own accord that we met each other. Nothing at DKS specifically pushed us all together. ,"I think the flashguide stories really helped normalize the college experience and brought the flashguides to the same level as the first year students. The flashguides helped destroy the social hierarchy by year that was the norm in high school. It was good to feel that they actually enjoyed our presence on a friend level rather than an ""upperclassmen"" level. Even though the flashguides were very involved, I think it would benefit incoming students even more to interact with them.  ",My favorite parts were making friends with a whole new group of people and the fun we had in the KIVA. Every activity that was hosted in the KIVA was so much fun and I loved it. The flashguides were extremely fun as well. ,Orientation was really really great. I was really worried about being able to navigate it without a parent figure there with me but the program made me feel really at easy with being on my own.

Yes. Make section for each language selected that we'd want and if we had prior experience with language easier to understand. Specify if the language was taking in a school setting or at home or else where so people can take a test accordingly. ,I think check in should be at around 4p.m. and the advinmsing meeting should be around 1p.m. the following day that way it isbt too early in day so people are actually motivated to do there scheduling rather than just dredging through the morning wanting to go back to sleep.,,Nothing really. I'm not a social person.,I just think ot should be more personalized experience. Most of the information felt repetitive and didn't help me. Some of it helped a lot but most of it felt like I was just sitting there listening to watered downed versions of information I heard 20 mins ago.,Probably the advising meeting because I felt the most confident about becoming a college student and where my first semester was heading.,Everyone was nice I just don't do well around new people and there were a lot of new people so I never felt comfortable opening up.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
No,,,,,,
,,,Maybe more activities that will encourage students to introduce and mingle with other students. This way students who are on the shyer side can get a chance to meet people without having to be the one initiate a conversation.,,The energy that I get from the flash guides and speakers was amazing and reassured me that I picked the right school. I’ve never felt more at home and secure than how I did at dks,
,We were told two different answers by my advisor vs. the advisor who spoke on day 1 regarding my math class.  Also there should be a time when parents are permitted to talk with advisors to answer any questions.  That seemed to be discouraged.,I would have liked to also have a more specific session that looked into majors & minors within my selected college.  ,I think it was good.,Various options of buying books  Study abroad options  ,The resource fair was helpful.  IT info was good.  Learning how much time I need to spend outside of class was super helpful.,"I appreciated the included meals, but truthfully the food wasn't good.  To me it was a convincing reason not to buy the dining plan.  Sorry"
,,,,,Meeting new people and seeing how satisfied the flashguides are with their experience at Kent was my favorite part.,
,I was not able to meet with the advisor for School of Music students. I was told he was unavailable and I would have liked to meet him. The other advisor who helped me was very kind and informative.,It was informative but there was not much information included that I hadn’t already found online.,I am outgoing and love meeting people.,Seeing more of the campus or discussing more major-specific topics.,Scheduling my classes because almost everything was included. I also enjoyed walking arounf campus in the evening and seeing the dorms.,I’m really excited to start this fall! Go Flashes!!

,"It was nice to get my schedule and everything and I know with there being so many kids it is hard to have enough advisors at the time, however I met with a graduate student and not my actual academic advisor which I wish I would have gotten to meet with. I also didn’t get to meet my advisor for the Honors college.",,,,Meeting future classmates and getting my schedule.,

Not really. I think it’s efficient in gauging the abilities of a student. ,"Nicole did a great job and really helped understand how the picking process worked. Her explanations, though fast, really made it easy for me to understand how my classes would be laid out this fall and possibly in the future. 6/5 stars. ",,"At first I was really nervous, but when Valla, one of the flashguides, made a point of how doing things that put you out of your comfort zone can lead to great things, I decided to really go out there and make the connections I wanted to make. So I guess just having that extra push was all I needed :)",The flash guide experiences are extremely insightful. Really having someone with perspective on how the university functions was fantastic. I think that a little more focus should be on those type of activities we did with the flash guides. ,I really loved the connections I made with other DKS attendees but I also loved how much information was provided on campus safety and just the general atmosphere Kent gave off. I was really scared I wasn’t going to like it but now I’m really ecstatic to be a Flash!,I didn’t get my name tag. That’s on me though. But that kinda sucked a little bit. 
Nope,,,"Not sure- just any of the events and activities at DKS were oppotunities to meet and connect with new people, if you made the effort to do so.",Nope- was pretty good to me,Probably walking downtown. It was really fun to be able to see whats all available near and on the campus along with getting to spend some time walking around and talking with my new-found friends.,N/a

,Learning about the future paths of my major and what classes I would take throughout my years at Kent. ,The Flashguides were all very fun and inviting. They immediately made me feel at ease about my stay and I felt reassured that I would have a fun time. They were all very approachable even to just talk about ourselves and what was going on. I loved each and everyone of their stories and personalities and their connection to eachother showed me how connected the student body really is. I miss them already and loved being with them. I was able to talk to them very openly about anything and they could all answer my questions I had happily. I never felt bored or as if I was annoying them which was reassuring. ,Smaller group times ,Each of the flash guides stories. ,"My favorite experience was during the first set of presentations with just the students.

,"My advisor was amazing, however, the scheduling of classes was not needed for me. I couldn't choose my professors like I have the past 2 years. When I went to correct the schedule when I was home, it would only let me the night of the 2nd day of DKS and not the next day. ",I literally skipped everything after lunch on the 1st day because as a CCP student I have already been through everything before. ,If my roommate wasn't cleared to go home and if I wasn't left alone all evening and night. ,Different types of books or resources required for different classes. Not specific classes but how some classes require an access code and you have to buy the book new to receive that. New student may not know this. ,I felt it was unnecessary for me to attend as I've taken CCP classes for 2 years already and know about everything. I also live 10 minutes from campus and would've preferred sleeping in my own bed instead of being left alone all night because my roommate was cleared to leave campus and go home for the night. ,
,,,,"I think it would be really great if there was just a little more time spent on meeting peers and “icebreakers” at the very beginning of Day 1 - especially before lunch. I met a lot of people during my time at DKS, but many of the people I talked to said they were uncomfortable because they either came alone and did not meet anyone they could share the experience with, or they came with a friend and felt as though they only spent time with that other person. Giving incoming students a specific time or activity where they could meet at least one other person that they could then eat lunch with and share experiences with would greatly benefit everyone in the program and allow for less of the loneliness and uncertainty that comes with entering this new chapter of life. ","I really enjoyed all of the time spent talking with and hearing from the Flashguides, especially the Flashguide stories. That program specifically made me feel great about coming to Kent State. I’m very familiar with the academic challenges of college because of College Credit Plus, however I’m slightly nervous about the social aspect of college and finding my place. Listening to the Flashguides, especially Becki, made me feel so comfortable and helped me to understand that everyone goes through some sort of struggle when they first enter college. ",
no,no comment needed,Way too long! Should have been condensed!!,people in my major,NO! LESS TIME ON ALL OF IT!!

"I didn’t like the fact that I never knew if I got something right or wrong. Sometimes it’s a confidence booster or a “get it together” type of notification once they tell you right after you submit it. Also I didn’t know how I should place the answer whether it was decimal form, faction form, should I put the ordered pair in parentheses etc. maybe if they could specify. ",Loved the fact that I didn’t feel rushed & how much knowledge (especially so specific to the fashion major) my academic Advisor knew— Emily. Could start session by reminding students that they have time & don’t rush (most things with guidance counselors have been rushed in the past during high school)     Shoutout to Emily— really a great advisor! ,,,,,
"Take the time to study and prepare because it might look easy, but it’s actuslly fairly difficult.",,,,,,
A study guide that you can look over before taking the test so we can know what to expect. Or at least the types of math that the test will cover.,"They were all so so helpful. With my case specifically I know things were really complicated because I had a lot of transferable college credit, and I was between majors or even on the verge of being undecided. Despite how frustrated I was getting at myself for not being entirely sure about where I would or should be headed, they remained completely empathetic and so very helpful in  making sure that I made the right decision despite how long I sat in their offices contemplating what seemed like some very important decisions. Not only that but they successfully answered all my questions and remained patientnu at any of my redundancy. I can definitely see myself furthering my relationship with quite a few of the academic advisors in my time at KSU. ",,A lot of the people in the business section of it weren't very talkative. I think we were all just kinda enclosed within ourselves. I'm not entirely sure there's a way to fix that unless there are more ice breaker activities.,I think that destination KSU was very informative and helpful. My parents were also satisfied about their experience with the other parents as well as the information that the staff gave them.,"Meeting with the advisors. Like I mentioned in a previous section of the survey, they were so very helpful, patient, and empathetic. I felt like I could immediately be connected and comfortable with them which typically doesn't happen to me with most people. ",
,,,More time in smaller groups,,,"The program was overwhelming and stressful. It made me realize I don’t want to go to school here. There wasn’t a lot of time to interact with other students so it was difficult to establish connections. It was near impossible to sleep because people were running through the hallways screaming and slamming doors all night. The RA went down there three times and they still were loud. It wasn’t very fun at all and my guest that came with me didn’t like it either. I had a pretty bad experience in all honesty, enough that it chased me off from attending this late in the summer. I hope you improve the program for future students that way they don’t feel so uncomfortable, stressed, and out of place. "

,"My academic advisor was incompetent. He tried to schedule me for a senior seminar even though I am a sophomore. Nobody in any of the offices wanted to give me a clear answer. There were no classes available for my degree. I was told to just take random classes so I could make it to 15 credits. Had I not already gone here, I would not have known any better and let them screw my schedule up. I am very unsatisfied with the schedule that was dealt and the overall experience. I had to set up an advising appointment with someone from my department because of how bad my schedule is. ",A waste of time. All of the information I was given I had already known. ,Not necessary ,No,I did not enjoy any of it. I found it very unnecessary ,"This was a very big waste of time. After being forced to attend two CCP orientations, I had to hear all of the information for the third time. I will be a junior this year and think it is absolutely ridiculous that my time was wasted like this. Due to the fact that I had to wait until this orientation to schedule classes, I was unable to schedule the classes I need as I have limited options at this point. My advisor was no help at all and screwed up my schedule very badly. The people in the registration portion of advising were also no help at all. As I do not plan on living on campus, I am not sure why I was forced to spend the night. Everything was extremely, extremely, unnecessary. I enjoyed my previous two years at Kent State but this experience left me very disappointed with the University. I hope some measures are taken in the future so CCP students do not have to go through this process. "
,"My advisor was very helpful and kind, she made me less afraid for this transition!",,"There was a lot of people who made groups and excluded others, maybe if there were random group assignments for the activities, etc.",Spend more time on what we are supposed to bring for our dorms/classes. ,Making friends that I was not expecting to make before coming to dks.,
 I was a CCP student  and I do not believe that I should have had to attend destination kent state. It was a waste of my time and did not learn anything. I knew what was being presented to me. I do not think anyone let alone former CCP students should have to spend the night. I should have been able to  schedule my classes earlier and not during destination kent state because it was a hold back. I am only upset because I was CCP. , My academic advisor had no faith in me about pursuing a major in Aeronautics.  He made several phone calls and stepped out of the office several times during our meeting with  no explanation. I started to cry because I he made me feel small and that I was not able to pursue this major. I left his office and switched my major. , It does not really matter what I put in this box because a formal complaint will be made. ,NA,, Filling out the survey ,
,"Even though I changed majors two days prior to my DKS, I was still able to be accommodated with little hassle! That was nice!",,,,The flashguides were definitely the best part! They were very kind and welcoming!,

,,,"They were kind,very respectful, fun and understanding.  ",They should have guides walk at a steady slow pace to help students feel accepted and Aldo help them if they don't know their way around. ,"Sleeping in the dorm for the first time, line dancing, and scheduling classes. ",
,,,,Have flashguides help you walk your schedule and find the right buildings,I found my roommate through DKS,

,- have us sit next to the advisor instead of across (if possible) because it'd be easier   - have advisor use VSP (or whatever the colored planning program is called)  - explain more ---> if you are waiting on credits to transfer what are the steps to take and how could that impact your schedule,,- being in small groups (in and outside of your college)    - doing (bonding) activities together     - less lecture (you have to be quiet and pay attention = hard to socialize)    - walk through campus?,- i think that there should be an optional time during days 1 and 2 for people to meet with their roommates (it could be a break for other people) because my roommate and I live in different states but we planning on meeting at DKS    - full campus tour (there was an optional one but we went to other optional ones instead and didn't get enough time to tour)    - more time with the flashguides ---> it was really great to get to know them but would have liked to talk more with them,the resource fair and registering for classes    resource fair:  it was really fun to see what is offered at Kent and interact with others and potentially get spirit items (Kent pens/stickers/backpack/shirts)    register:  was what i was waiting for throughout all of day 1 and 2. I was really nervous and SUPER excited  ,thanks for all of the hard work that made this experience possible!!

I enjoyed the engagement, the material, and her as a professor. I felt more connected and excited to/for going to Kent after her presentation than most of DKS.     I believe a lesson like that would be better as an icebreaker than the ones we did. Most icebreakers try to break up the group in many small sections, but usually only result in awkward, uncomfortable situations. I enjoyed cheering on the rock paper scissors finalists more than I enjoyed playing myself. Coming together as a group in my eyes is more effective as an icebreaker rather than getting to ""know your neighbor"".     I also liked the smaller group session with the Flash Guides.","Some of the presenters were unbelievably boring. In my eyes, the presenter does not have to be from that department to give a presentation on the material. Bad presenters result in people not caring and falling asleep. The things that people remember and connect with were presented by good presenters. If someone cannot give a good presentation, it should be given to anyone else, even if they do not have first hand experience in the department. "
"I think if we were required to review before taking it, because I hadn't practiced precalc in a while, just to refresh our memories.",,,more smaller groups,No I think it was good timing ,"Touring downtown and the ""party"" at the end",
,,,,More breaks to check out the services that were being explained to us. It was one set of information after another and there was no time to physically see what Kent State has to offer. The information was also extremely repetitive and it was if the speakers didn’t talk with each other about their presentations and then decided to present on the same topics just worded differently. ,,"I also think we should have been given the option to stay off campus in a hotel if we so choose and if not then I don’t feel that we should be forced to stay in a room with a complete stranger. I get the whole “meet new people and make friends”, but having to share a room with someone is different. If a parent was present we should have had the choice to stay in a dorm with them. "

"When I went to take the foreign language assessment, the assessment would not load and flash line would not show my final score. Also, it would not show that I took the assessment.

I was able to talk to other students in and out of my major and get to know who the other students are.,"I loved all of the presentations, but I felt like some of them were rushed and that some of the information was rushed through.

When talking with my family member who attended as well it seemed as though they were told a lot of information the students were not such as the research projects and how to set up the financial aid plan. We sad through lengthy meetings all day discussing things we already knew. I feel as though a day and a half was not necessary when most of the information could be read in a packet.

,,,,,,The choices of food could have been better. There should have been food available for the students as the night came on. The studio arts college focused way too much on fashion and none of the Studio Arts and it’s caused my father to feel the need to walk back to the student center to make sure I wasn’t in the correct major.

I did not need to take the placement tests based on my CCP credits.,"I expected it to be very personalized since we were at Kent specifically for this, but then I had issues with my schedule and didn't even understand it until later because I was so rushed.","Some of the sessions seemed unnecessary, I feel like I could have gotten the information on a flyer rather than sitting for so long. Honestly most of the incoming students zoned out, looked at their phones, or even fell asleep in the ballroom because we sat their getting information for so long. Also, it was nice bonding with people at night but I feel like if some of the sessions were more concise we could have made it a one day event. ","When we went to lunch without our parents I was nervous that I didn't know anybody, but this was good because it forced me outside of my comfort zone and I became friends with the people I sat with to eat.","A lot of my friends at other colleges played more ""team bonding"" kind of games. Also more interactive seminars would keep our attention better.",My favorite part was making some friends and connecting with the flashguides.,I had a better experience with DKS than I expected and it got me excited for next year. I would love to be a Flashguide next year!

,"Once I reviewed classes with my advisor and he took me to the computer lab to schedule my classes, I sat there for 5 minutes in silence without instructions. I was told to sit and that was it. No ""hi my name is,"" ""presentation will start when more people come,"" ""we will get started in a minute"", or ""login to your flash line."" I just sat and wondered why I was even there. ",,,,,

a lot of the presentations were useful but there were a select few that put the whole audience to sleep. especially the hour long public relations presentation that had nothing to do with destination kent. i had a great time but would prefer that all the presentations had a purpose to make the long day go by quicker and more organized ,my academic advisor was amazing she should not change a thing! ,,,,,
Allow students to see their scores immediately after completing the assessment to ease stress and possibly encourage them to reassess for a better score. ,Completing the earlier appointments before moving onto the later appointments.,,More socializing time during the day instead of it all taking place at night.,When separating into different colleges I would have enjoyed being able to explore the section of campus the majority of our classes will take place in.

"This was a very fun experience. The only thing I would suggest is maybe have a couple of more breaks, there was a point in time where there was a lot of talking and a lot of info being thrown out. But other than that everyone was super helpful and I can’t wait until the fall! ","After I looked over my schedule more I noticed I didn’t take a math or English in my schedule, I’m assuming that is okay since the advisor did not say anything but maybe be more clear about how and what classes to take. Again my fault for not looking over more to ask questions. ",,More activities like when we split up for our colleges. ,,"The evening gathering was really fun, it gave us a chance to talk and get out of our comfort zone and have fun together as a whole.

","I made a connection in the dining hall because there weren’t a whole lot of tables, so we were forced to sit with people we didn’t know. I didn’t like that at first, but ended up meeting an amazing family. I met four other people at the night party thing with the karaoke.

Have the housing director teach those giving presentations throughout the day how to actually keep students’ attention about topics they may not quite care about. Cut the amount of time for many of the long lectures, if you need an hour, you are saying too much and it won’t get remembered.","THE SECOND DAY!!! As a student not technically on campus in the fall, many of the first day’s topics were spent with people I won’t be around until the spring who I didn’t know or have the opportunity to meet, and I will have to complete a similar orientation before the spring anyway, so the second day really helped. I got to meet people in my Program and talk and learn more about my opportunities. It felt more personalized.",The information provided felt repetitive from any campus tour. Break-out sessions that aren’t required could provide a better opportunity for people interested in certain topics to learn about them and to find where to acquire more indormation if need be. Have parents do the financial and other sessions while students actually meet one another so socializing is not inhibited by parental presence.

It would have been really helpful to know room assignments for the upcoming school year before DKS so that way we know how big our rooms would be and what to expect. Also it would have been better to look at the options for scheduling for a longer period of time. We got 15 minutes.....    also when we split off into the different colleges we played jeopardy and that was a waste of time.

,,"The guy that spoke was very informitive about the process, and he was entertaining to listen to as well. You could tell by listening to him that he loved to help others and that he had a heart for students. Note: It may look like I ""Kind  of did the portion above this because I selected the same answer for each subject, but I swear that I didn't do that. I had such a great time at Kent!",I thought that the fact that there was a little (but not too much) downtime helped me get to know other students,I thought that everything was well planned and thought out,,I had so much fun!!
,,,,,,
,,,,,,It was good but looking back over this survey I feel that we should of toured the campus more over some of the talks
,,,,,,
,,,N/A,Overall navigation of the campus. ,Meeting with people I’d never thought I’d be friends with and staying connected with them right after orientation. ,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,My advisor was very friendly and helpful. She was willing to help me schedule classes that were both required and extra classes I wanted to take.,It was fun and very helpful to understand which classes I would need to schedule and what I would have credit for already.,Maybe more icebreakers or opportunities to talk to the people in our same college more.,"Maybe make it easier to find flash guides after our advising appointments so we can walk through our schedules. Also, if the model rooms are close due to construction, that should be noted.",I really enjoyed the walk into downtown Kent becuase it helped me to figure out what else was around campus.,
,,,More personal icebreakers that forced people to talk to someone they didn’t know.,"Although there are very few with this situation, take some time to talk with CCP students who have enough credit to be classified as Sophmores or Juniors. Explain opportunities available to them due to their class standing.",Learning that the arts and athletics events are free to students.,"My only negative comment: The students were very loud in the dorms when others were trying to sleep. For example, people were talking right outside my door. There should be some type of quiet hours established or a lounge where people who want to stay up and talk go."
,I loved how my advisor showed me different ways to schedule/ see my classes ,,more time to talk to other people ,where buildings are / what,meeting new people and scheduling my classes ,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,The new online books buying process. ,I loved meeting with my academic advisor t schedule my classes and purchase my computer. Everyone was so helpful. ,

,,,More opportunities to interact with other students ,,,
,,,,,,
,"Advisor was great, registration not great. wouldve preferred to have staff help rather than students",,,,,Most of the people in my hall said they skipped all the sessions and only went to meals. i strongly reccomend a better attendance policy if possible 
,,,,,,
,,I think the DKS experience should be two full days because the first day was stressful because it was so much information,more pairing up with people,,,
,,,I put myself outside of my comfort zone. ,,Flashguide stories. This was my favorite part because it made the flashguides feel more approachable. ,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Math online is hard.,,,"Prior to arriving at DKS, you could have filled out a survey about yourself, and been matched with someone compatible with yourself ",,,
,,,,,,

,The academic advising team was able to get me into a class based on my minor which was full. It was deeply appreciated! ,,More confidence ,,Scheduling my classes,
No,,,,student involvement ,meeting new friends & experiencing living in a dorm (using the bathrooms and sharing a room) ,
,,,,,,
,,,,No,Sleeping -long day,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,I think it was too long. I feel like it could've been a day long as opposed to two full days. 
It was confusing because a lot of people thought they were going to have the opportunity to take it twice. As in they thought they could take it again immediately after and not complete a course or what was offered before you could take it for a second and final time. I think there should more clarity of that. ,,,,,,
,,,,,I thought that walking to my classes was the most informative thing I did at DKS.,

,,,one was my roommate but also people from my college,,,
,,,Be more outgoing and be the conversation starter.,Seperate into the individual colleges more. These are the people we will see a lot I want to be able to get to know them better before school actually starts.,I liked making my schedule because I really liked the one on one time with the advisor. After that I walked around and found the building where my classes would be in and now I can finally feel more comfortable about the campus.,

,,,Major ,,,"I didn’t get to have a roommate for the overnight stay, I was personally fine with that I didn’t care, but my parents felt really bad and mad about that. I feel that that situation should probably be resolved because if someone who really cared about that and not wanting to be alone, would experience a not fun first time at Kent and in the dorms. "
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,"I am not sure because I think connection are made over time and can not be forced upon 2 day. However, I did talk to new people. ",I think a little official tour of the campus would have been nice.,The dinning was very nice and enjoyable. ,

,,,Less people ,,,
,,,"It would have been better to be matched with your roommate via a survey to find like interests. In addition to this, I wish I would have met my roommate in the morning instead of at the end of the day; we arrived at different times. ",,I enjoyed the advising period because it was a one on one experience rather than an experience shared by 300+ people.,"The program was very long and there was some information that could be better presented through email or mail. By the end of the day, my family and I were very tired and chose not to participate in meet-and-greet events for this reason. Although it was a very informative few days, it was just so long that by the end of the first day, we were ready for a break."
